# Tweet-Sentiments-Analysis-About-Ukraine
In this project, we have performed sentiment analysis of tweets about Ukraine and predictive analysis using random forest classification methods.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 10,000 tweets related to the keyword "Ukraine."
Twitter sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone in the tweets.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Columns 'polarity,' 'subjectivity,' and 'Sentiment' were dropped.
Null values were dropped from the dataset.

Sentiment Analysis:
VaderSentiment library was used for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment scores ('polarity', 'pos', 'neu') were calculated for each tweet.
Sentiment labels ('Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive') were assigned based on polarity scores.

Word Cloud Visualization:
Word cloud was created to visualize the most frequent words in the tweets.

Text Preprocessing:
Tweets were converted to lowercase and non-alphabetic characters were removed.
Stop words and URLs were removed from the tweets.

Sentiment Encoding:
Sentiment labels were encoded using LabelEncoder.

Feature Encoding:
TF-IDF vectorizer was used to convert the text data into numerical features.

Model Building:
RandomForestClassifier was trained using TF-IDF features for sentiment classification.
Model performance was evaluated on the training data using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Prediction on Test Cases:
The trained model was used to predict sentiments for a set of sample tweets.
Results were displayed, showing the original tweet and the predicted sentiment.

Conclusion:
The project involved loading and cleaning Twitter data, performing sentiment analysis, visualizing word clouds, and building a machine learning model for sentiment classification.

Future Improvements:
Fine-tuning the model parameters for better performance.
Exploring additional natural language processing techniques for feature extraction.
Enhancing the preprocessing steps for improved text cleaning.
This summary provides an overview of the key steps and tasks performed in the sentiment analysis project.
